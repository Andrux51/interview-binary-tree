# Binary Tree Exercise

Given a binary tree, similar to shape as below, write an algorithm to count the number of times each `value` appears.
 
## Assumptions:
 
1. Each node will have a `value` prop
2. Each node may or may not have a `left` prop
3. Each node may or may not have a `right` prop

## Expected output for the given tree:
